	\section*{Question 1 (50 points): Education}
	
	A school counselor was curious about the average of IQ of the students in her school and took a random sample of 25 students' IQ scores. The following is the data set:\\
	\vspace{.5cm}
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=41, lastline=41]{Forster_PS01.R}  
	
	\vspace{1cm}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Find a 90\% confidence interval for the average student IQ in the school.
		
		\noindent Z-Score = 1.64 Sample mean = 98.11 Sample sd = 13.1
		
		\noindent Perform a 2-Sided Test
		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=42, lastline=50]{Forster_PS01.R}
		
		\noindent Interpretation: We are 90\% confident that the population mean for Student IQs falls between 94.1 and 102.7 \\
		
		\item Next, the school counselor was curious  whether  the average student IQ in her school is higher than the average IQ score (100) among all the schools in the country.\\ 
		
		\noindent Using the same sample, conduct the appropriate hypothesis test with $\alpha=0.05$.
		\item Conduct a 1-Sample, 1-Sided t-Test 
		\noindent Ho: $\mu$ $\le$ 100 Ha: $\mu$ > 100\\
		\lstinputlisting [language=R, firstline=63, lastline=65]{Forster_PS01.R}\\
		\noindent Interpretation: We fail to reject the null hypothesis. We have no evidence to support that the high school students in question have an average IQ higher than 100\\  
	\end{enumerate}

	\section*{Question 2 (50 points): Political Economy}
	
	\noindent Researchers are curious about what affects the amount of money communities spend on addressing homelessness. The following variables constitute our data set about social welfare expenditures in the USA. \\
	\vspace{.5cm}
	
	
	\begin{tabular}{r|l}
		\texttt{State} &\emph{50 states in US} \\
		\texttt{Y} & \emph{per capita expenditure on shelters/housing assistance in state}\\
		\texttt{X1} &\emph{per capita personal income in state} \\
		\texttt{X2} &  \emph{Number of residents per 100,000 that are "financially insecure" in state}\\
		\texttt{X3} &  \emph{Number of people per thousand residing in urban areas in state} \\
		\texttt{Region} &  \emph{1=Northeast, 2= North Central, 3= South, 4=West} \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{.5cm}
	\noindent Explore the \texttt{expenditure} data set and import data into \texttt{R}.
	\vspace{.5cm}
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=73, lastline=73]{Forster_PS01.R}\\ 
	\vspace{.5cm}\\
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item
		Please plot the relationships among \emph{Y}, \emph{X1}, \emph{X2}, and \emph{X3}? What are the correlations among them (you just need to describe the graph and the relationships among them)?
		\vspace{.5cm}
		\graphicspath{ {./template/} }
		\noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Problem2.1}
		\noindent Variable Y has a positive correlation with variables X1, X2, X3.\\
		\newpage
		\item 
		Please plot the relationship between \emph{Y} and \emph{Region}? On average, which region has the highest per capita expenditure on housing assistance?\\
		\noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Problem2.2}
		\noindent The West, or Region 4, has the highest average state expenditure\\
		\vspace{.5cm}
		\newpage
		\item
		Please plot the relationship between \emph{Y} and \emph{X1}? Describe this graph and the relationship. Reproduce the above graph including one more variable \emph{Region} and display different regions with different types of symbols and colors.
		
		\noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Problem2.3.1}
		\noindent There is a positive correlation between X1 and Y\\
